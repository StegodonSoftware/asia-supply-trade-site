## About Us Content

### Company Story
Founded on over a decade of hands-on experience in Asian agriculture and food sectors, Asia Supply Trade connects high-quality Canadian agricultural commodities with trusted buyers across Asia.

The company is led by Kelly Cailes, who brings over 10 years of direct business development and sales experience across ASEAN, Oceania, Japan, and South Korea. This experience was built through commercial sales programs delivered both directly to end-users and through established local partners.

During this period, Kelly worked extensively with food manufacturers, food ingredient companies, feed mills, pet food producers, distributors, and trading companies, providing first-hand exposure to procurement decision-making, quality management, and logistics constraints.

Asia Supply Trade is deeply connected to a network of established importers, distributors, and trading companies who serve as trusted in-market partners with in-depth local market knowledge and long-standing commercial relationships.

Today, Asia Supply Trade leverages this combined experience and partner network to supply Canadian-origin oats, wheat, barley, pulses, and canola, focusing on reliability, transparency, and long-term commercial alignment across food-grade, feed, and pet food markets.
